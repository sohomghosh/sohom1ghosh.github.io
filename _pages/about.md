### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Sohom (à¦¸à§‹à¦¹à¦®) here!
I am a passionate Data Detective with hands-on experience in solving business problems. 
I have been working on Data Sciences across different industries like Financial Services, Internet and so on. Presently, I am working as a Senior Analyst - Data Science at the Artificial Intelligence Centre of Excellence of [Fidelity Investments](https://www.fidelity.com/), Bengaluru, India. 

In addition to being the co-author of the books [Natural Language Processing Fundamentals](https://www.packtpub.com/in/big-data-and-business-intelligence/natural-language-processing-fundamentals) and [The Natural Language Processing Workshop](https://www.packtpub.com/in/data/the-natural-language-processing-workshop-second-edition), I have several [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7Jm4_McAAAAJ&hl=en) in proceedings of international conferences and refereed journals.
I am a Computer Science Engineer and I hold a Master's Degree in Software Systems (with specialization in Data Analytics) from [BITS Pilani, India](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/).

In one sentence, "I am a Data Scientist by profession, an Engineer by qualification and an Artist from within". ðŸ˜„

I love [reading and playing harmonica](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDFFMnTn71JcYqXO3IpRUsw).
I am a fitness buff and I believe that "Health is Wealth".
