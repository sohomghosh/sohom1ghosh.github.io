I am a passionate **Data Detective** with hands-on experience in solving business problems across different industries like Financial Services, Internet and so on. My research interests include **Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. In addition to being the co-author of the books [NLP Fundamentals](https://www.packtpub.com/in/big-data-and-business-intelligence/natural-language-processing-fundamentals) and [The NLP Workshop](https://www.packtpub.com/in/data/the-natural-language-processing-workshop-second-edition), I have several [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7Jm4_McAAAAJ&hl=en) in proceedings of international conferences and refereed journals.

I hold a **Master's Degree** in Software Systems (with specialization in Data Analytics) from [BITS Pilani, India](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) and a **Bachelor's Degree** in Computer Science and Engineering. Presently, I am working as a **Senior Analyst - Data Science** at the Artificial Intelligence Centre of Excellence of [Fidelity Investments](https://www.fidelity.com/), Bengaluru, India. Outside work, I love reading and [playing harmonica](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDFFMnTn71JcYqXO3IpRUsw). Being a fitness buff, I believe that "Health is Wealth".

 In one sentence, **"I am a Data Scientist by profession, an Athlete by choice and an Artist from within".** üòä
