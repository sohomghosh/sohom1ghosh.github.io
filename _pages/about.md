### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Sohom here!
I am a passionate Data Detective with hands-on experience in solving business problems. 
I have been working on Data Sciences across different industries like Financial Services, Internet and so on.
In addition to being the co-author of the books [Natural Language Processing Fundamentals](https://www.packtpub.com/in/big-data-and-business-intelligence/natural-language-processing-fundamentals) and [The Natural Language Processing Workshop](https://www.packtpub.com/in/data/the-natural-language-processing-workshop-second-edition), I have several [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7Jm4_McAAAAJ&hl=en) in proceedings of international conferences and refereed journals.
I am a Computer Science Engineer and I hold a Master's Degree in Software Systems (with specialization in Data Analytics) from BITS Pilani, India.

In one sentence, "I am a Data Scientist by profession, an Engineer by qualification and an Artist from within". ðŸ˜„

I love [reading, trekking and playing harmonica](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDFFMnTn71JcYqXO3IpRUsw).
I am a fitness buff and I believe that "Health is Wealth".

Feel free to reach out to me by email or through LinkedIn.
